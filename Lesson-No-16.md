# Creating a communication plan

The goal of every communication plan is to keep everyone in sync. Despites the proposals of some *agile gurus*, the agile methodology does not provide much guidance on how to coordinate your activities during iterations.

It's up to the team to figure out what is the best way to organize, communicate, receive feedback and pull things together. Now let's take a look at the critical components that go into any agile communicatio plan and how you can make one that fits just fine for the entire team. At the end of this lesson you'll have the beginnings of some rythm and ritual for continuously producing something of value on your project.

First let's start by looking at four things you should do during any iteration. Besides the change, there are other two constants on any agile project:

1. Setting expectations
2. Getting feedback

continuously setting expecations is necessary because things are always going to be changing, good habits come in handy like meeting regulary the customer and reviewing the current state of the project, and because the simple act of putting working software in the hands of your customer changes the requirements, you're going to want that strong feedback loop to make sure that you're hitting the mark.

## That *must have* items to keep on during every iteration

Here are four things you're going to want to do to get some rythm and deliveryng ritual going on during each of your iterations.

1. [Make sure the work is ready](#make-sure-the-work-is-ready)
2. [Feedback on last iterations stories](#feedback-on-last-iterations-stories)
3. [Plan next iteretion work](#plan-next-iteration-work)
4. [Look for areas of improvement](#look-for-areas-of-improvement)
