# Beyond the theory
Congratulations, at this point you've got the theory and really know everything there is to know about user stories. What we gonna get into now is how do you actually go about gathering them.

That's because before we can go off and create an agile project plan we need a list of all the features are customers think they might like to when they see in their software (the Master Story List). And one way to do this is to host a story gathering workshop, a venue for the development team and customer to get together and write user stories about the system they like to build.

## Story Gathering Workshops
The goal of the story gathering workshop is __breadth__. You wanna cast as wide and add as possible, and discover as many features as you can.

It's not because you're necessarily gonna build them all, it's more because you just want to get everything on the table and make sure you've got the big picture.

There's nothing super complex here, it's basically comes down to: 
1. Sitting down with our customer.
2. Drawing lots of pictures
3. Writing story cards based on what you hear. 

That's really it.

## How do you organize your own
Here's some tips on how to host a great story gathering workshop.

### Get a big open room.
Open rooms are just fantastic. You want something and you can easily get in there, stand up, move around, better yet if is a room with white boards and markers and flipcharts, things you can stick on walls, big open tables. You know, whatever it takes to get the story discovery process flowing.

### Draw lots of pictures.
Then once you're starting to get a sense of what customers are looking for draw lots of pictures. I mean there's no one way to do this you've got lots of great techniques such as:

* Personas.
* Flowcharts.
* Scenarios.
* System maps.
* Process flows.
* Concept designs.
* Storyboards.
* Paper prototypes.
* Maybe your own!

Remember we're shooting for __breadth__ here, so be careful not to dive too deep into the details. I mean, you can if you want explore a bit but you must try to keep a high level overview. And once you've got a few really good pictures and understanding of how the system needs to work, you're ready to start mining those pictures for stories.

### Wrile lots of stories.
Now using your new diagrams and pictures let's walk through them with our customer and extract stories as you go.

With a flow chart the proccess are revealed letting the user stories trickle down as we went, and that's great.

Or if you've got one application that has some really key screens you could try to take these screens, identify the purpose of each component on it, and break them down into smaller pieces of functionality.

And when you're extracting your user stories, look for small end-to-end pieces of functionality that usually takes one to five days worth of effort it's okay if some of then are bigger, we call these epics, these are big stories that take a couple of weeks.

Epics are handy for high level planning or for capturing big stories that we think we may need to have to take on but are not really sure yet. If you have some major pieces of functionality like this treat them like any other story and break them down if and when they come up for development.


## Finally but not least
At the end of the day, ten to forty high level stories are usually enough to capture three to six months of planning.

If your stories number in the hundreds you're either planning too far ahead or you've got in too much details. Remember we're shooting for __breadth__ not depth so don't deep dive and get lost in the weeds.

Brainstorm everything else because as good as pictures are they don't always capture everything we need to sometimes doing a project. For example you might have historical data you need may need to migrate , you may need to capture some low testing artifacts, maybe you got some softwares compliance or regulatory things you need to do like data privacy and security,  production support documentation, training materials,  two weeks of user acceptance, stress testing.You know whatever all these things and more need to be captured in the cards and prioritized and treated just like any other deliverable. If there's something you need to do even if it's not software related go ahead and create a card for it and write it down.

Finally scrub the list and make it shine.

Once you've got your initial list of stories it's good to go through a few times looking for duplicates, looking for things you might have missed , grouping logical stories together and consolidating them into a simple easy to understand to do list of things you need to deliver.

Congratulations you now have the beginnings of your project plan and that's all there really is to user stories.

See you in the next class.
