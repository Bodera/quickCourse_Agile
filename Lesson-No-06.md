# Agile teams
In this section of the course we gonna take a look at:

* What makes agile teams tick.
* What are they characteristics.
* How they are different.
* Some tips on forming your own.

## How agile teams are different?
Do you have ever check for what makes a group and a team different from each other? Don't worry I already checked it for you.

| Basis of comparison | A group | A team |
|:-------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Meaning | A collection of individuals who work together in completing a task | A group of persons having collective identity joined together, to accomplish a goal |
| Leadership | Only one leader | More than one |
| Members | Independent | Interdependent |
| Process | Discuss, Decide and Delegate | Discuss, Decide and Do |
| Work products | Individual | Collective |
| Focus on | Accomplishing individual goals | Accomplishing team goals |
| Accountability | Individually | Either individually or mutually |


Agile applies roles of analysis, coding and testing all together on the same team for the same project. That way we can break down the silos, transparency is the law.

Another difference of agile teams are blur of roles. Thinking on it as like a mini-startup: the people peach in and do whatever it takes to make it sucesfull, regardless of title, position or role.

Analysts, programmers, testers, and so many other nearly defined roles doesn't exists in agie project in traditional sense. Let's take quality for example, __quality is a team responsability__ on a agile project. Agile just does not bind to the notion that a single group or entity could ever be responsable for quality in a project, it just doesn't work. Quality assurance, User experience, Business analytics, Project manager, Developers, Testers, that's all a mutual responsability.

## People wear multiple hats
Not all projects have full-time dedicated analysts or testers. But that doesn't mean that analysis and tests don't get done, they do! Someone else like the developer or the PM does them. Same for other roles.

## Some of they characteristics

* Co-located
* Engaged
* Self-organizing
* Empowered
* Cross functional

Let's explore each them from now on.

#### Co-location
If you could arrange every members of your team to sit together, your productivity will increase. Co-located teams just work better, they provide:  

* Questions get answers faster
* Problems get fixed on the spot
* There is less friction between all the different interactions
* Tests get built more quickly

It's very hard to compete with the power of small co-located teams. But that does implies you can't run a agile project with a distributed one. In fact, if you are working with a distributed team it will be wise consider to reserve some budget from the start of your project to bring everyone together, even for a few days and even better if can be for a couple of weeks. Because that times spent to know each otter, joking around and eating together goes a long a way to turning a right tied bunch distributed around the world into a tied right performing team. So you can always try to bring everyone together at the start of your project and after that you can use every communication tool you want to make you distributed team seems like a small co-located one.

#### Engaged customers
There is a lot of softwares distributed today by teams who doesn't have engaged customers. How can teams be expectaded to build compelling, inovative products if the very they are building them for aren't part po the process?

Engaged customers are those who show up the demos, answer questions, give feedback and provide the guidance and insights necessary to the team to build compelling software.

XP methodology applies this agile principle of business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project by the __Onsite Customer__ concept. Also Scrum has the role of a __Product Ownwe__. That it's a big part of the job.

But what could be the probably reason for you don't have engaged customers?
* -Maybe it's a project they don't need.
* -Maybe your customers been let down in the past.
* -Maybe they just think that you don't going to deliver!
* -Maybe they last project wasn't very fun.
* -Maybe they're tired of having projects done to them by IT departments.
* -Maybe you didn't do a good job of meeting  expectations last time around.
* -Maybe they are just really busy!

Whetever the issue if you need to build credibility with your customer fast try this, in the next time you sit in front of your customer take some problem your customer has and make it go away. Don't ask for permission, don't make a big cerimony in this, just take some problem they got, some issue they have and simply make it go away. Then do it. Come back two weeks later, show up how do you solve the problem and do it again.

It could be anything, and doesn't have to be software related. Repeat and rinse. It will take some time before they pay some attention on you, but eventually they will. By doing that you are building trust, one deposit at a time, and proving that you're a fierce executor who can be counted on to get things done.

#### Self-organization
Agile teams likes to be given a goal and have everyone stand back as they collect to figure out how to get there. And to do that agile teams need to be self-organized.

Self-organization is about checking you ego at the door and working your team to figure out how you as team with all of your great, unique skills, passions and talents can best deliver this project. Sure Doggy can cut code, but he also has a great eye for design so he's gonna be helping us with some of the mock-ups. And then there's Latifa one of out best testers but she also really shines when setting expectations with the customer, she just have a way and she loves doing it.

Now look, this doesn't mean developers need to be experts in visual designs or testers need to be able to handle all the project management, it's more an acknowledgment that the best way to build teams is to let the role fit the person instead of forcing the person to fit the role!

So how do you get yout team's to self-organized? 

1. You let them create the plan.
2. So it's they responsability to come up with the estimates.
3. Then they will take ownership of the project.

You worry less about titles and roles, and become more interest in seeing the continuous production of working tested software. And you look for people who can take initiative, can think for themselves, and don't sit back and wait for orders. Just let the reins go, and trust and empower them to get the job done.

The empowerment and accountability are the key that enable a good agile team. But till here we not told that it's an easy task, not everyone wants to be empowered, after all why bother when it's so much easier just to show up, told people what vegetables to chop and do exactly what you told?

If you think you have an issue with accountability on your team, there is an easy fix. Get your team to demo their software. The simple act of putting teams in front of real life customers and having them demo their software will go miles towards making your team more accountable. This works because:

* The team will see that real people are counting on them to deliver.
* They will realize these are real people with real problems who need real software to make their lives better.
* It will only take one bad demo for your team to take a sudden interest and making sure their software is ready for feedback and everything works.

They will insist on becoming empowered and they will make it happen. If they don't, well then you're in serious troubles because you might not have the right people.

#### Cross-functional teams
A cross-functional team is one that can serve the customer from the beginning to end. That means having the necessary skills and expertise in your team to take any feature your customer would need and be able to develop it for them fully.

When recruiting people for your team you're gonna want the generalists people who are comfortable working on a wide variety of things.

For programmers that means finding people who are comfortable watching the entire technology stack like User Interface, Business tier, Server side configuration. Not just the front-end or back-end.

For testers and analysts that means people who are just as comfortable testing as they are doing deep dive analysis on requirements.

But this doesn't mean specialists are never used! Specialists are used on occasion when the team lacks some sort of specific skill such as database tuning or information security. But mostly the team sticks together and works together as one for the duration of the project of course they would be self sufficient.

The speed at which they can go without having to wait for permissions to negotiate resources from others is the gold here. They can start delivering value from day one.

## Typical roles in agile projects
In fact there are two major roles in an agile project, there are people who know what needs to be built, nicknamed customers, and there are people who know to build it, nicknamed the development team.

Agile is just a little bit less concerned about who plays what role and it's more worried about the right rule being played. Let's start by taking a look at one of the most important roles on any agile project.

#### The agile customer
This people are the source of truth from which all requirements flow on an agile project. They are the people for whom the software is being built.

Ideally they would be subject matter experts:

1. Who's intimately familiar with the business;
2. Who really cares about the software does;
3. Know what it looks like;
4. Know how it works;
5. Who is committed to guiding the team answering questions;
7. Provides feedback;
8. They also set the priorities, they decide what gets built and when.

This isn't done in a vacuum, it's a collaborative process with the development team because there are many technical reasons why it makes sense to work on some features before others.

Example scenario: you may want to reduce some technical risk, but generally they set the priorities from the business point of view and then work with the development team to come up with a plan to make it happen.

Also they have the fun job of deciding what not to build, as deadlines approach, and time and money start to run out. Of course to do all these things it really helps if the customer is engaged and working very closely with the development team, ideally full-time, preferably co-located and onsite. 

XP used to refer to this role as __On-site customer__ and Scrum had the role of the __Product owner__. But don't panic, if you don't have our can't get a full time customer, because few teams can, you can still do agile and have a very successful project. Not all projects need or require a full-time customer, what's more important is to understand the spirit of where agile methods like XP and Scrum are coming from which is:

> The success of you project is directly proportional to the involvement of yout customer.

#### The agile development team
Should be a cross-functional group of people who can take any feature the customer would like to see developed and turn it into production ready working software. This includes analysts, developers, testers, database administrators, and anyone else required to turn user stories into working software.

But taking a deeply traditional software team and suddenly telling them to self-organize maybe not work very well. For it you need to know more deeply the categories which support that role.

* The agile analyst  

When a feature comes up for development someone has to get in there and figure out all the nitty gritty details of how it needs to work. The analyst is the relentless detective who asks the deep probing questions and gets the thrill from working closely with the customer to really understand what they need in their software. The software analyst do a lot more: they help customers rate users stories, they do the deep dive on the analysis when a story comes up for development, and they can help create mock-ups, prototypes and diagrams, and use everything in their analysis toolkit to help communicate the essence of the story.


* The agile programmer

Agile programmers are pros because they take things like software quality very seriously. The bests are passionate testers who take pride in their work and are always looking for an edge in writing higher-quality code and to do that there are certain things that agile programmers do when regularly creating high-quality production-ready. First of all they write lots of tests and will often use tests as a means of driving out their designs, secondly they're continuously designing and improving the architecture of their software using techniques like refactoring and paying down their technical debt, thirdy they make sure the codebase is always in a state of production readiness and ready to deploy at a moment's notice. Also they work very closely with the customer and everyone else on the team to ensure that what gets built works, that it is as simple as possible and that pushing software into production is smoothly.

* The agile tester

They know that although it's one thing to build it, it's another to know that it works. And for that reason the agile tester will insert themselves into the agile project early ensuring that success for the user stories get to find upfront and that when working software needs to be produced it works. Because everything on an agile project needs to be tested you will find the agile tester everywhere.

You'll find them working side-by-side with a customer helping capture the requirements in the forms of tests. You'll find them closely with developers helping test automation, looking for holes and an extensive exploratory testing by trying to make break the application from all angles. They will also have in mind the big testing picture and never lose sight of load, scalability, exploratory, stress, integration, security testing and anything else the team should be doing to produce high quality software.

* The agile project manager

The only way they'll be successful is if the team is successful. Because of that they go remove every roadblocks standing in the team's way, it can be in the form of co-located workspace, fast computers, software licenses, even back massages and foot rubs (why not?). Part of this means continuously planning, re-planning and adjusting course when necessary, but it also means setting expectations upward and outward to the greater project community, getting the status reports to stakeholders, forging relationships within the company and shielding the team from outside forces when necessary.

The good agile P.M. doesn't tell the team what to do though, they don't have to do that. They've already helped create an environment such that the team is mostly independent and would continue to deliver fine in the P.M. absence. In fact the hallmark of a good agile P.M. is the ability to disappear for a week of two and no one would be the wiser.

* All the other players

And then there's all the other important rules and people we didn't mention such as the DBA, the SysAdmin, techinal writers, trainers, business improvement, infrastructure, networking, user experience designers. product support and many others. They are all part of the development team and gets treated just like anyone else in the project.

## Conclusions
In this class we studied deeply about what makes an agile team powerful, from now on we gonna study how to plan your own agile project, including: estimations, master stories lists, team velocity.
