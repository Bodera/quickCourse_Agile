# How agile is different from the traditional waterfall mode?

## This is the first
You will never done requirements in a Agile software project, just how you will never done tests or design. 
 
As long the customer has features they would like to see, and the budget delivering. These activities goes along of the project, they aren't phases. Thats is one big difference.
 
## Iterativity
The other is development iterative. Iterative means we start with something simple, almost trivial, and continuously adds to it through the project. This prevents us to have to get it right of front and to customers discover what they need as we go.

## Change is the only constant
Third one is adaptive planning, we've alredy touch that aspect. There is no such thing as statical plan in Agile, the plan, just like real life, changes all the time:
* Customers discover new requirements;
* Customers change they mind, and requirements changes as well;
* Priorities change;
* Teams change;

Instead of resisting all that change, Agile accepts and abraces it. Why fighting something thats naturally goes to happen?

## Fourth difference: Roles Blur
People have especialty in Agile projects, but the roles really blur. For example, there is no QA department in a Agile project because, everyone tests!
Developers write unit tests, testers do analysis, analists help customers write tests, the PMs get out of the way. 
Think in Agile teams as very small startups, everyone pictures in wherever it takes. Tiles and rules don't really matter.

## Scope can vary
We have got a couple of topics when in working with software projects, like time, budget, quality and scope. Agiles fixes all of them except one: the scope. 
Scopes varys because:
* Is too easy to actually push our dates;
* We don't expect more money;
* We don't mess with the quality;

## Requirements changes
Software  was used to be very hard to change, and has a reason for that, changing requirements is a lot cheapper than changing production code. But it evolves into fear and resistance, but there is no plausible reason for that.

Nowadays for one business, changes happens faster. The customes must be able to change. Therefore, the cost of change not have to be exponential, it can actually be flat. 

So you should be flex on scope, change the customer mind, iterate, and figure it out as you go. Working software is the primary measure of success.

## Definition of success
The definition of success in Agile projects is different than the traditional model.

In the traditional one, its all about the plan. *Project Plan*, *Tests Plan*, *Requirements docs*, *Architectural diagrams*, *Analysis models*, *Security Reports*, *Deployment Plans*... they are all of no value to the customer.

Of course budget and schedule still matters, but that's not what we are here for. Too many projects are comming with On Time On Budget but delivering no value. Agile focused success more in the one thing thas is any value in the software delivery process: __the software!__ If it doesn't works, it doesn't matters how good our documentation is, and how good ours plans are, its all about the software, and what it does for our customer.

## Conclusion
So things may have started to make more sense? Simple stuff rigth? In the next class we will discuss more about some Agile myths.
