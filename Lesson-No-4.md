# Agile myths

## Agile is a silver bullet
I wish that was true, but unfortunely you can fail just as spectacularly on an Agile project as on any other software delivery methodology. __You just might do it sooner__.

Look, there is no magic here. You saw at the beginning how Agile planning works, in fact  the doc in Agile may initially make harder because you're gonna be asking people the change how they work. Never easy.

Secondly is gonna highlight and show how disfunctional some things or features are, and some people may not like that. So don't take this if you're looking for some quick and easy, Agile is not your silver bullet.

## Agile teams don't do documentation
* More accurate to say:
  > Agile teamns don't write unnecessary documentation.
* Documentations gets treated like any other deliverable.
  > That means estimated and prioritized.
* Prefer face-to-face communication.

## Agile is anti-planning
* Agile teamns plan extensively:
  1. Every quarter (release planning)
  2. Every couple weeks (iterations)
  3. Every day (daily stand-ups)
* Prefer burndowns over Gantt charts

Agile projects plans continuously and visibly.

## Agile is undisciplined
I don't know where this myth came from, because nothing can be futher than the truth.
1. You must test.
2. You must get feedback.
3. You have to regularly ship working software.
4. You must update the plan.

This all takes extreme discipline.

## Agile is anti-architecture
Agile believes in keeping things simple and push back hard against the over complex upfront design becoming popular in software projects.

When it comes to software architecture, Agile believes in building only for what is immediately required, and not try to feature prove systems and anticipation of non-features requirements.

Remember that KISS? Keet ip simple! And nothing about adding complexity for complexity sake. Extreme programming, one of Agile methods which we will study later, have a term for this: __YAGNI__: You ain't gonna need it.

## Agile doesn't scale
* Agile scales just like any other software process
> Not that great
* Instead of lookin for ways to scale up, try to imagine ways in which you could scale down.

The one thing Agile does bring to scalability party however is a challenge to organizations to make their projects smaller, no more than six to ten people. Avoind all that megaprojects, which tends to be way more fragile.

## Conclusion
Well done, now let's take a look at couple of the more popular Agile methods today, and see what each one has to offer.
