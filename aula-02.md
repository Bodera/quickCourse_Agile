## What Agile is?
Let's pretend that you are the customer for a while. It's your money, your project, and you team. How do you get the confidence that they are actualy delivering? How do you know that they actualy delivering value? Would you feel good if they give you lot of documentation, like the requirements of the project? Or would you feel better if they give you really good low-level detailed plans, that scheduled everything wich has to be delivered. Or you will feel better if every week the team showed up a demo to you, working software, working stuff consisting in features you've asked for, built, test, and ready to be deploy on the production.

First rule 
Break big problems into smaller ones. 

Seconde rule
Focus on the really important stuff, and forget everything else.

Third rule
Make sure of what you are delivering actualy works.

Fourth rule
Crave feedback.

Fifth rule
Change course when necessary. Adapt you plan.
