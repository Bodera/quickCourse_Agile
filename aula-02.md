## What Agile is?
Let's pretend that you are the customer for a while. It's your money, your project, and you team. How do you get the confidence that they are actualy delivering? How do you know that they actualy delivering value? Would you feel good if they give you a pile of documentation saying the requirements of the project? Or would you feel better if they give you really good low-level detailed plans, that scheduled everything wich has to be delivered. Or you will feel better if every week the team showed up a demo to you, working software, working stuff consisting in features you've asked for, built, test, and ready to be deploy on the production.

##### First rule 
You break big problems into smaller ones.  
You can't do everything in a week, so break the most scared ones into smaller, simple, manageable tasks.  

##### Seconde rule
You focus on the really important stuff, and forget everything else.  
Most of our traditional delivering software project has a little or no value for the customer. Sure we need documentation, yes we also need plans, but they all support only one thing: __*working software*.__  
By delivering software valuable every single week, you're forced to be lean and drop anything it doesn't add value. As a result you travel lighter and will take what you need.

##### Third rule
You had make sure of what you delivery actualy works.  
Delivering something in value implies in what you delivery had better work. That means testing, lots of it, early and often.  
No longer some it will be slot off at the end of the project, testing becomes a way of life.

##### Fourth rule
You'd crave feedback.  
Because you know you will never hit the target if you do not stop and regulary ask your client if you are aiming the right target.  
Feedback is the headlight that cuts the fog and keeps you on the road while you go down the hill at 100 mph without your customer losing the ability to drive and you end up in the ditch.

##### Fifth rule
You'd change course when necessary.  
Because stuff happens. What is really important when we can be irrelevant the next if you blindly follow a plan you won't be able to roll the punches when they become.  
So in reality messes with your plan, you change your plan not the reality.  

##### And finally...
You become accountable. When you commit to delivering something of value every week and showing your customer how you spent their money, you start to own things, you own quality because you don't want deliver a crappy product.  
You own the schedule because you know they're counting on you to tell them when they can expect things to be done.  
You set expectations and you spend the money as if you were your own.

Now none of this has anything to do with Agile, and yet it has everything to do with Agile because this is basically how agile software delivery works.  
We show up every week. We show our customers how we've spent their money through working software and we make sure it's ready to go to production.  
So one way to think about Agile is the delivery of working software every couple of weeks.  
And here's another.  
How do you deal with the problem of having too much to do and not enough time?  
Let's pretend you've got a really busy weekend coming up. You already know you are going to be able to get everything done on your list and you're starting to feel a bit overwhelmed.  
What do you do?  
Well if you like most of us, start by making a list. This simple act of writing everything down feels great.  
You make a list, see what's on your plate, and slowly but surely a plan begins to form just by putting it all down there and getting it all out. Then you spice things up.  
You look at your list, get a sense of how big some things are and start to get a sense and feel of power long it's going to take to do some of these things. Then you set some priorities.  
You accept that there's more to do and your list and time will allow. So let's set some expectations with yourself, maybe others, and you prioritize because at the end of the day what else are you going to do. Then you start executing.  
You start working the plan. Somethings go according to the plan, others don't. Somethings are easier than expected, somethings harder. But at the end of the day you get done what you can and punting that which you can't. And of course you change course when necessary.  

In Agile instead of tasks, guesses and To Do lists, we use fancier names like Master Story lists, estimates and user stories.  
Traditional   |     Agile
--------------|------------------------
Tasks         |     Master Story lists
Guesses       |     Estimates
To Do lists   |     User Stories

  
This is agile planning 101. If you understand how to make lists, set priorities, and change course when things don't go according to plan, you pretty much get everything there is to understand what you are agile planning.  
You already know Agile. You already understand how this works.   
Along this couse, we will be covering just how to apply the simple everyday concepts to the creation of software.  
Now you maybe wondering. That's not so simple. In the real world there's budgets to be met. Commits to be made and promises to be kept.  
So keep you eye for the next classes.
