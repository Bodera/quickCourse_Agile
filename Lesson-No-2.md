# Exploring the agile way

Ok forget the word *agile* for a second and pretend that you are the customer on your own software project. It's your money, your project, and your team.

What would give you confidence that the team is actually delivering? How would you know if they're actually delivering anything of value? And what is valuable on a software project?

Would you feel good if they gave you a pile of documentation describing the requirements of the project? Or would you feel better if they gave you really good, low-level detailed plans, outlining the schedules milestones and when everything could be expected to be delivered? Who knows, maybe you would feel better if every week the team showed up and demo to you working software, consisting of features you've asked for, built, tested, and ready to be deployed into production.

When you start looking at software delivery through the lens of a customer, good things naturally start to happen:

__\#1)__: You break big problems down into smaller ones.

A week is a short period of time, you can't possibly do everything in a week. So to get anything done, you have to break big scary problems down into smaller, simpler, manageable ones.  

__\#2)__: You focus on the really important stuff, and forget everything else.

Most of what we traditionally deliver on software projects is of little or no value to the customer. For sure we need documentation, and yes we need plans, but they are in support of only one thing: __working software__. By delivering something of value every week you're forced to get lean and drop anything that doesn't add value. As a result, you travel lighter and take only what you need.

__\#3)__: You make sure that what you deliver actually works.

Delivering something of value implies that what you delivery had better work. That means testing, lots of it, early and often.  
No longer something to be sloughed off to the end of the project. Testing becomes a way of life!

__\#4)__: You crave feedback.

Yeah that's because you know you will never hit the expectations if you don't stop and regularly ask your customer if you're aiming at the right target. You crave for feedback, it's the headlight that cuts through fog and keeps you on the road as you're barreling down the highway at 100 mph. Without your customer the ability to steer is lost and you end up in the ditch.

__\#5)__: You change course when necessary.

Stuff happens. What was really important one week can be irrelevant on the next, if you blindly follow a plan you won't be able to roll with the punches when they come. So when reality messes with your plan, you change the plan not the reality.

Then finally you become accountable. When you commit to delivering something of value every week and showing your customer how you spent their money you start to own things.

You own quality because you don't want deliver a crappy product. You own the schedule because you know they're counting on you to tell them when they can expect things to be done. You set expectations and you spend the money as if you were your own.

Now none of this has anything to do with agile, and yet it has everything to do with agile because this is basically how agile software delivery works.

We show up every week. We show our customers how we've spent their money through working software and we make sure it's ready to go to production.  

So one way to think about agile is the delivery of working software every couple of weeks.

And here's something else. How do you deal with the problem of having too much to do and not enough time?

Let's say you've got a really busy weekend coming up. You already know you aren't going to be able to get everything done on your list and you're starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. What do you do?  

Well, if you're like most of us, you start by making a list!

This simple act of writing everything down feels great. You make a list, see what's on your plate and slowly, but surely, a plan begins to form just by putting it all down there and getting it all out.

Then you spice things up. You look at your list, get a sense of how big some things are and start to get a sense and a feel of how long it's going to take to do some of these things.

Then you set some priorities. You accept that there's more to do on your list that time will allow. So let's set some expectations with yourself, maybe others, and you prioritize because at the end of the day what else are you going to do?

Then you start executing. You start working the plan, somethings go according to the plan while others don't. Some things are easier than expected, some things harder. At the end of the day you will have done what you can and will know that which you can't. And of course you change course when necessary.

In agile, instead of tasks, guesses and to do lists, we use fancier names like master story lists, estimates and user stories.  

Traditional   |     Agile
--------------|------------------------
Tasks         |     Master Story lists
Guesses       |     Estimates
To Do lists   |     User Stories

This is agile planning 101. If you understand how to make lists, set priorities, and change course when things don't go according to plan, you pretty much get everything there is to understand what you are planning. See? You already are agile. You already understand how this works.

Along this couse, we will be covering just how to apply the simple everyday concepts to the creation of software.

Now you say - *"That's not so simple."*. In the real world there's budgets to be met. Commits to be made and promises to be kept. And it's all true, but don't worry, you will learn how to set and manage expectations so you and your team are able to work this way.

See you in the next classes.
