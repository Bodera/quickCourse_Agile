# User Stories
By learning to gather requirements as user story, you will see how agile plans are always kept up-to-date, contain only the latest information, and you will discover how you can do premature upfront analysis.

## The waterfall way
Heavy documentation as means of capture the  requirements never really works on software projects.

Customers achieve a low level of satisfaction, the team builds unnecessary stuff, and lots of time and energy are wasted in what was written but not in what really has to get done.

The traditional documentation can't handle changes in an efficient way and by doing so the team actually builds according to the spec instead of what the customer wants. When you write something and suddenly freezes the spec, you are cutting off one of the greatest sources of learning and endeavor: the feedback.

Also based in the out-of-date docs your team can be led to perform false assumptions and bad guesses. They waste time by discussing with each other instead of getting clarified by the customer.

And you can even think that maybe, just maybe, doing more documentation can resolve the situation. The problem when you are gathering requirements isn't enough volume is the gap of communication. You can't have a conversation with the documents, not a engaged one.

Em extreme cases mistakes in grammar can cause millions of dollars to companies. [I brought an example for you](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/business/worldbusiness/25comma.html)

Here is an agile principle:
> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

So now we know that we need.  
1. Something that enables us to have a conversation about requirements.
2. Captures the essence of what our customer wants.
3. Small enough to planning and descriptive enough to remind us of what we're talking about.

See you in the next class.
