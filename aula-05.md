# Which method is right for me?
The first thing to understanding is that is no one Agile method, they're many. Some grown popular like Scrum, but others has been run for a very long time like Lean. Let't take a look at three of the most popular nowadays, starting with Lean.

## Lean - for improving
Lean comes from Toyota's ultra efficient car manufacturing process.

Now Lean is not an IT specific Agile method but it's concepts like eliminating waste, pool systems, and building people are very compatible with Agile and software.

##### Pros
* Very good high-level principles and practices.
* Address system and organization efficiencies.

##### Cons
* Not IT specific.
* Requires great discipline to implement.

It worths studying Lean, it haves a lot to offer, recommended reading

## Scrum - for planning
It is a project management wrapper. Can be used for non-IT specific projects.

##### Pros
* Easy to understand.
* Low barrier of entry.
* Non-threatening.
* Currently very popular

##### Cons
* Silent on engineering
* Easy to skip the hard stuff

Easiest to adapt. Most non-threatening.

## Extreme Programming (XP) - for engineering

This method offers continuous design in form of refactoring.
Automated builds by mading unit tests, continuous integrations by running continuous builds, and insane notion that the tests should be written first before the software is developed, it's the oposite of conventional wisdown from the last 50 years.

XP projects really excited me, they are very efficient and fun to work with.

##### Pros
* Sound engineering.
* Loved by developers.
* First real main stream Agile method.

##### Cons
* Very developer focused.
* Not inclusive of other disciplines.
* Sometimes characterized by zealots.

Essential engineering practices
1. Unit testing
2. Refactoring
3. Continuous integration
4. Test-driven design (TDD)

## Options for adopting
* XP full on.
* Scrum + XP engineering practices.
* Scrum + XP engineering practices + Lean spirit.

You should start with XP engineering practices first, then you pick a language between Scrum and XP, and how more about Lean you study, best for you, your team, and your customer.

## The three simple truths
Once you accepted it, it will dispenses much of attention in drama we currently see in traditional software process.

1. It's is impossible to gather all the requirements at the beginning of a project.
2. Whatever requirements you do gather are guaranteed to change.
3. There will always be more to do than time and money will allow.

But that it's not a reason to afraid to begin, you will discover things along the way and you start small or you never start. The act of delivering software itself changes the requirements. The short time and budget is just the state of any interesting project.

You know that you have too much to do, you know you don't have all the requirements, and you accept the ones you do have are going to change. Once you accept this you gonna be able to think and innovate in a better level of focus.

It's all about the mantra: 1) You set priorities, 2) You assure to do most important stuff first, 3) You leave least important tasks til last.

## Conclusion
There is no one way, you do whatever works for you. 

You have scrum as an approach for managing and planning. You have XP leading the best engineeting practices for software delivery. And you got Lean for continous improving.

__Agile is not a checklist__. And you're gonna have to keep thinking, each project is different, but we lookup for assure rapid feedback, delivery working software to customers, and improve continuously.

You may be confused along the classes by the difference between certain terms in XP and Scrum methods, we're gonna adopt the XP nomenclature. See how they interchange:

XP  | Scrum
----------- | -----------
Iteration  |  Sprint
Master story list  |  Product Backlog
Customer  |  Product Owner

Now you've got the basics of what Agile methodology is. Congratulations.
