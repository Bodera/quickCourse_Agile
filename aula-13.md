# Flexing on scope

Being flexible around scope is how agile projects maintain the integrity of their plans. By insisting their customers drop an old story every time a new one comes in, agile teams work within the means of their projects while giving their customers the ability to change their minds without paying an exorbitant price.

This is one of the key agile principles:

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customers competitive advantage.

The customer does not always have to drop an old story when a new story comes in.

For example if its a feature they really want and are prepared to pay for it, they could push out the date.

What customers can't do however is add something to the list and not expect something of equal size to come off. That is a wishful thinking and there is no place for that in agile planning.

When it comes to pushing out the date or being flexible about scope, agilists generally prefer the latter.

What we aren't good at is shipping working software on time. But regardless of whether you're delivering on a fixed date or not, being flexible in scope is a concept that you and your customer must start to become very good at, to keep your plans real and avoid your team from biting off more than they can chew.

But what if the customer refuses to be flexible about scope while insisting that you and the team take one more work. Well you have got a couple of options in that situation.

First, you could perpetuate the lie, turn a blind eye and continue to follow the old plan pretty much just like everyone else does.

Or you could give overly optimistic estimates, ignore the team velocity, and hope and pray that things turn out good in the end. This is often referred as management by miracle.

Or you can present the facts as they are! Tell it like it is, and sit down and wait in that awkward silence until your customer realizes that you aren't going to cave.

You are going to continue the odyssey.

Now let's take a look at how to build our very first agile plan.
