# Agile planning
Dealing with reality.

Yeah, Murphy's law takes no prisoners when it comes to disrupt your best laid plans. So don't get mad with reality for keeping messing your Gantt Chart.

If you don't have a strategy for dealing with change then your project is going to eat you alive.

In the next classes we are going to learn how to create plans that you can believe in, and commitment's that you can follow through with, you and your team.

By learning how to plan projects the agile way you will be able sleep easier by knowing that:

* Your plans are always up-to-date.
* There are reasonable and honest expectations.
* Change now isn't something to be feared but, instead, something to be used as a competitive advantage.

## The problems with static plans
Has this ever happened to you?

Your project starts off beautifully. You've got a perfect team, the right technology, the perfect plan, and for the first few weeks of your project life couldn't be better.

Then, out of nowhere, __BAM!__. Your team changes, your lead developers gets pushed to another project of greater strategic importance. So you wonder "Ok, we still got time, we can handle this".

Then, all of a sudden, __KAPOW!__. You realize you aren't going as fast as you'd thought. What you thought your team can do and what they can actually do are two completely different things.

Then, just about halfway through the project, __TILT!__. You realize your customer actually only now has discovered what they really want.

That simple, easy to build, web app suddenly looks a lot more daunting and complex. Now it's virtually impossible with the remaining time and resources you've got.

And then, the real bomb goes off, __BOOM__. You are running out of time. It turns out business needs your application sooner rather than later. And in the rush to meet the new deadline, testing gets cut, the team is asked to cancel their vacations, and when it finally comes time to *go live* it is of such poor quality that no one can use it.

So it becomes another __late__, __over budget__, __failed__ IT project.

Changing teams, reduced schedules, and ever shifting requirements are the norm for any interesting software project!

To deal with these realities we need a way of planning that does the following:

* Delivers great value to our customers.
* It's highly visible, transparent and frank.
* Lets us makes promises we can keep.
* It enables us to adapt and change the plan when necessary.

With this context of having to deal with change, lets now study the agile plan.
